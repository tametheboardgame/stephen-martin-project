## SP-WP1.1: Main-character baseline complete

**Human gate required for each new likeness.**

1. Confirm Stephen's approved character sheet remains the anchor.
2. **David design approved:** 6 ft 2 in, bald, blue eyes, short dark ginger/auburn beard. Original `david-character-baseline-v01.png` in Drive (`1DJLH4ni0z81_SMrslKx99z_U2agTm8vS`); manifest at `generated-assets/manifests/character-david-baseline.json`; target `public/assets/generated/characters/david-baseline.webp`. The asset was materialised successfully by GitHub Actions run `38225490240`. Output `public/assets/generated/characters/david-baseline.webp` has blob SHA `0324afa1d3dee0a070701a31bc210c529c6061a4`, matching an independent WebP conversion from the approved PNG. David's approved art and canon were merged in [PR #2](https://github.com/tametheboardgame/stephen-martin-project/pull/2).
3. **Paul approved:** Revised character sheet with clean-shaven face and characteristic blank expression. Original `paul-character-baseline-v01.png` in Drive (`1J-_Zxy7U7VGAnUS9S3L7CAAR54KNaSYk`), manifest `generated-assets/manifests/character-paul-baseline.json`, destination `public/assets/generated/characters/paul-baseline.webp`. GitHub Actions image materialisation **succeeded** in run `38228062469`. The committed WebP has Git blob SHA `2ec53c41eac4d4e9da9b81fdfaf059796a4dcc53`, independently reproduced from the exact human-approved source PNG. The character reference was merged in [PR #3](https://github.com/tametheboardgame/stephen-martin-project/pull/3), squash commit `770f3b5e`.
4. Main-character appearance references are recorded in `docs/CREATIVE-BIBLE.md` and `docs/ART-DIRECTION.md`; approved art is registered in the manifests.
5. Define/design a fictionalised boyfriend when story requirements justify it, keeping the mystery ambiguous.

**Status:** All three principal character baselines (Stephen, David and Paul) are approved and committed to `main`. SP-WP1.1 main-character visual baseline complete. The boyfriend's fictional appearance remains deliberately deferred until needed by the story.

## Completed work package: SP-WP1.2

**Story/script approved by owner 12 October 2026:** `docs/story/SP-WP1.2-OFFICE-OPENING.md`, `docs/story/SP-WP1.2-GAME-TREATMENT.md`, and `docs/story/SP-WP1.2-IMPLEMENTATION-HANDOFF.md`. These detail a 3-minute scripted office opening, playable Stephen activity selection, a brief David-and-Paul rescue investigation, three small mini-games and respective cutscenes, all targeting 15–25 minutes. **All three stories, mini-games and the comic false-alarm reconstruction ending are approved for development.** SP-WP1.2 is complete. **Next: GAME-SP1**, a standalone playable three-minute office opening using existing approved character assets, advancing to a basic Stephen holiday placeholder. Preserve the 15–25 minute total target, the privacy boundary, and keep new artwork and engine complexity minimal.

## SP-WP1.2: Privacy and comedy bible (approved)

- Owner-approved privacy rule recorded in `DECISIONS.md` (SP-D009), `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT.md`, `ROADMAP.md` and `docs/CREATIVE-BIBLE.md`.
- **Stephen Martin** is the only real-world full name allowed in public project content. Other protagonist names are first-name fictional labels; don't publish actual employer/office, partner/relative identities, real contact information, private relationship/family details or precise real-world itinerary.
- All conspiracies, holiday misunderstandings, relationship/family complications, detention scenarios and body-parts plots are **comedic inventions**, never assertions about the people who inspired them.
- A real named protagonist and stylised likeness may still be recognisable. Keep publication behind the existing explicit owner approval and privacy review gate.
- The narrative beats and office script were approved and merged in PR #6; the next phase implements that approved material.

## GAME-SP1: Office opening preview (owner-approved for main)

- Owner approved the SP-WP1.2 story package, merged in [PR #6](https://github.com/tametheboardgame/stephen-martin-project/pull/6) at `22d7806b5c36dacc0cea4a8c0f9bedc8ab204e4f`.
- The owner played the GAME-SP1 office preview and expressly approved it for merging into `main` on 12 October 2026. Small opening-scene feedback is still expected; handle that in a subsequent bounded PR.
- Seven approved scene shots and 64 dialogue beats are recorded in `src/office-data.js`. `index.html`, `src/game.js` and `src/styles.css` provide responsive comic staging, the three approved character sheet assets, back/next/skip/replay controls, optional local sound cues, simple resume, and a clearly labelled Stephen holiday placeholder.
- No boyfriend drawing, game engine or third-party service is required. Static Cloudflare Pages deployment can occur automatically when this merges to `main` if the owner has connected the service; the public website remains a preview, not the completed game. Full Stephen's playable route and rescue mini-games remain GAME-SP2/3.
- Cheap local `npm run verify` syntax and behaviour tests run in a dedicated GitHub Actions workflow. It packages a self-contained office-preview archive after a successful smoke run.
- **Gate cleared:** owner approved the office preview and explicitly requested merge to `main`. Check public Cloudflare build and owner feedback after merging. Do not silently start all three game routes.

## GAME-SP1.1: Opening polish pass (in development)

- **Owner-approved scope:** Autoplay by default, manual Pause/Play/Next/Back, per-line timing and timer safeguards; expressive character reactions; comic close-ups for risk assessment, printer and rescue chat.
- **Working branch:** `agent/game-sp1.1-opening-polish`, separate from the deployed, owner-approved GAME-SP1 on `main`. Do **not** merge while new character art/cutaways await visual sign-off.
- **Execution:** A) timer and controls; B) small individually human-reviewed Stephen/David/Paul expression variants; C) three cutaways and transitions; D) focused CI and hosted branch preview, then approval.
- **Next after polish:** GAME-SP2, Stephen's selectable holiday and shared rescue investigation. Maintain the 15–25 minute total scope and fictional/non-identifying character rule.

## Operating notes

- Keep changes small and reviewable in short-lived feature branches.
- Do not turn this into another large/complex game; target 15–25 minutes with no unapproved scope creep.
- Song may run in parallel; comic pilot is optional.
- Production/public publishing requires separate owner permission.
