# Project status

**Updated:** 12 October 2026  
**Master roadmap:** Approved version 1.0, `ROADMAP.md`  
**Primary scope:** Complete **15–25 minute** point-and-click/touch comedy game; three concise endings; approximately 2–3 substantial mini-games. Song alongside; comic optional.

## Foundation

- Repo: `tametheboardgame/stephen-martin-project`, currently **public**.
- Foundation delivery: [PR #1](https://github.com/tametheboardgame/stephen-martin-project/pull/1), merged into `main`.
- Image pipeline: tested successfully end to end in GitHub Actions run `38221823786` on 12 October 2026.
- Staging folder: `1C6kezJBL_sexyHmxeLnFnzpj-Zbn9iC6`.
- WIF provider: `projects/878071288497/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github/providers/stephen-martin-github`.
- Service account: `stephen-martin-assets@unicorn-valley-510010.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
- Stephen original: Drive file `1TkKP-qc-pM4kVrWlwzay0sFHTLG9Ao8z` (`stephen-martin-character-baseline-v01.png`).
- Approved Stephen derivative: `public/assets/generated/characters/stephen-martin-baseline.webp` (GitHub blob `73ce1539332fad89c456eeec348471ef91bd75f4`).
- One unrelated generic image thumbnail was mistakenly displayed in chat; **that thumbnail is not canon**. Use the actual committed Stephen sheet.
- Approved project constraints and workstream rules are recorded in `ROADMAP.md`, `PROJECT.md`, `DECISIONS.md` and `AGENTS.md`.

## Next work package: SP-WP1.1, Establish the main characters

**Human gate required for each new likeness.**

1. Confirm Stephen's approved character sheet remains the anchor.
2. **David design approved:** 6 ft 2 in, bald, blue eyes, short dark ginger/auburn beard. Original `david-character-baseline-v01.png` in Drive (`1DJLH4ni0z81_SMrslKx99z_U2agTm8vS`); manifest at `generated-assets/manifests/character-david-baseline.json`; target `public/assets/generated/characters/david-baseline.webp`. Generated asset materialisation and branch merge are being finalised.
3. **Next:** obtain visual references for Paul and generate/review his comic character sheet.
4. Create concise canonical appearance/personality notes and register approved assets using the Drive pipeline.
5. Define/design a fictionalised boyfriend when story requirements justify it, keeping the mystery ambiguous.

**Done when:** David and Paul sheets are visually approved, materialised into GitHub, and character canon reflects those approvals. David's visual approval has been granted; Paul remains pending. Then proceed to SP-WP1.2 (short narrative/comedy bible).

## Operating notes

- Keep changes small and reviewable in short-lived feature branches.
- Do not turn this into another large/complex game; target 15–25 minutes with no unapproved scope creep.
- Song may run in parallel; comic pilot is optional.
- Production/public publishing requires separate owner permission.
